# GdxDemo3D
GdxDemo3D is an ongoing game project built with [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx), demonstrating various aspects of the game library, as well as its extensions, such as the physics engine [Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org/) wrapper and the artificial intelligence library [gdx-ai](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai).

A simple 3D scene is included, along with an animated human character.

The Bullet physics library is used to handle collisions and forces between objects.

The [gdx-ai pathfinding](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Pathfinding) module in conjunction with a navigation mesh handles pathfinding, the [gdx-ai steering behaviors](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Steering-Behaviors) module handles character movement while [state machines](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/State-Machine) and [behavior trees](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Behavior-Trees) are used to model human and dog brains respectively.

Ragdoll physics allows for dynamic character animation when a character falls down.

Objects in the world can be modified directly in Blender and exported into the game with an automated script.
